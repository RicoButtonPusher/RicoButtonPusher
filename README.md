### Hi there 👋 my name is Parker and I'm a Software engineer with a proven ability to lead large teams and adapt to achieve results in dynamic and strict environments. Before transitioning to a career in software engineering, I demonstrated my ability to lead and organize as I directed, filmed, and provided strategic planning to create a 20-minute film of 150+ people reenacting a pioneer trail through Wyoming. As a life-long learner, I dedicated 2,000+ hours to learning Full Stack Software Development through bootcamp structure and self-directed learning. My passion for learning combined with a perseverance to achieve in the face of adversity led me to learning Spanish over 2 years while living in Argentina without any formal training. I am now excited to apply my leadership, perseverance in hunting results, and appetite to learn on a talented, collaborative software development team to deliver quality, intuitive front-end applications.
